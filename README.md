This is my final Front End Capstone project with NSS. The app is an attendance tracker for instructors and employers. It will also act as an automated information exchange to pass along data to whatever team the user is signing into for attendance.

I wrote this app because in my life I have been in both situations. As a student I hated to ask for the daily agenda or to ask the instructor to repeat themselves. And as a manager/instructor I found that there is an incredible amount of time wasted on reptetive tasks like these.

MVP achieved on 8th. Final MVP Approval Feb 11th.
