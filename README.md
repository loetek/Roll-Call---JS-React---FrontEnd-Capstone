# Project Title

Roll Call

## General Information

This is my final Front End Capstone project with NSS. The app is an attendance tracker for instructors and employers. It will also act as an automated information exchange to pass along data to whatever team the user is signing into for attendance.

MVP achieved on 8th. Final MVP Approval Feb 11th.

## Purpose 

I wrote this app because in my life I have been in both situations. As a student I hated to ask for the daily agenda or to ask the instructor to repeat themselves. And as a manager/instructor I found that there is an incredible amount of time wasted on reptetive tasks like these.

### Installing

1. Clone repository
2. Cd src
3. Npm install
4. From root directory cd public
5. Run json server on port 5002
6. Open localhost: 3000 in the browser of your choice
7. Feel free to register for an account and test as a student. See additional instructions for testing as instructor.

### Testing

Since the purpose of the app is for instructors and students design decisions were made to keep those users separated. Thus it is a two-sided application. So on the registration page, you will not be able to log in as an instructor. In order to test the instructor side of the application feel free to use the credentials below.

#### Instructor
Username: moss@me.com
Password: pass

#### Student
In case of errors with registration try login.
Username: jd@me.com
Password: pass

If you come across any testing problems feel free to reach out anytime to jdwheeler0@gmail.com.
